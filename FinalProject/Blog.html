            <h2>Review of Star Wars (1977)</h2>
            <h3>12-1-16</h3>
              <p class="ok">The original Star Wars is one of the best movies ever made. It follows the journey of a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker,
                who teams up with the mysterious and wise Ben Kenobi, the scoundrel Han Solo and his loyal sidekick Chewbacca, and his two droid companions,
                R2-D2 and C-3P0, on their quest to deliver stolen plans to the Death Star, super weapon of the evil Empire, led by Darth Vader.</p>
                <p class="ok">On their journey, they are captured
                the Empire and brought aboard the Death Star, where they discover that there is a Princess Leia in need of rescue. They make their escape, and
                then team up with the Rebel Alliance to destroy the Death Star, defeat Darth Vader and save the galaxy.</p>
                <p class="ok"> The movie does an excellent job
                at creating a unique and exciting universe, teeming with alien creatures and exotic planets. For its time, the movie shows impressive
                special effects that never cease to amaze. The characters are charming, heroic, and brave, and Darth Vader would go on to be recognized
                as one of cinema's greatest villains. The first in what would become one of the biggest (if not the biggest) franchise of all time, 1977's Star Wars
                created by George Lucas is a must see for any fans of film.</p>

            <h2>Review of Ready Player One by Ernest Cline</h2>
            <h3>11-30-16</h3>
              <p class="ok">Ready Player One is a book I've read recently, and while not the best I've ever read, it was certainly a fun read.
                The book follows a young boy in a collapsing world plagued by energy crisis, where people have turned their backs on real life and escape
                into a virtual reality called the OASIS.</p>
                <p class="ok">After the billionaire-genius who created the world passed away, he left behind a hunt for three keys
                in the OASIS, that if found, would lead the winner to fame and fortune. The boy, Wade, dedicates his life to the discovery of the keys, and embarks
                on a journey with friends to complete the challenge, where danger lurks not only in the game, but in the real world as well.</p>
                <p class ="ok"> The book is a great
                read for young audiences, and is completely jam packed with references and homages to 80s pop culture. The author, Cline, goes a little overboard in some areas,
                but mostly finds a fun way to incorporate his love for nerd culture into a thrilling story. The characters are sterotypical, but fun and likeable, and
                make the twists and turns in the story more compelling. Though the world of the OASIS comes off as a massive fantasy that any kid would love,
                its easy to think that anyone could enjoy themselves in the world of OASIS. If you're a fan of pop culture, especially from the 80s, I recommend giving it a try.</p>

            <h2>Why the Lions are good this year</h2>
            <h3>11-29-16</h3>
              <p class="ok">2016 has been a crazy year. If you need evidence of this, look no further than the fact that the Detroit Lions are currently in first place
                in the NFC North, and will most likely win it. So, how did this come to be you may ask? Well, I have some thoughts on that! At the beginning of the year,
                I didn't know quite what to expect from this team. 8-8 seemed likely to me, though by looking at their schedule I thought it was quite favorable. While 8-8
                could still end up being the Lion's record, this is unlikely to me.</p>
                <p class="ok"> After a 1-3 start, I began to chalk this up as another wasted year, however, things turned around
                when they hit a 3 game homestand and got wins over the Eagles, Rams, and Redskins. They were 4-3 after that, with each game being decided by 7 or less points,
                and each win involving them taking the lead back in the 4th quarter. The defense got better during these games, though still not totally healthy, they played much better
                than they had previously. This allowed them to keep games close, especially against teams like Washington and Philly. But the real reason for why the Lions are doing so well
                is this: the majority of NFL teams this year are largely average; most teams are floating around .500. The Lions themselves are closer to these teams in terms of play quality,
                but they differ in one key area, which is the 4th quarter.</p>
                <p class ="ok" >Now, we know that Matt Stafford is clutch, we've seen him lead comebacks before, but he's taken it to a whole new level.
                I would go as far as to say he's mastered the art of the comeback; he simply plays his absolute best late in games. So this is what seperates the Lions this year, the ability
                come from behind and outplay opponents on both sides of the ball late in the game. They will probably lose some more games, but they will win some more too, and
                even though they may not be as good as a Dallas or New England, their late game edge gives them a dangerous advantage over opposing teams, and who knows, maybe they
                add one last surprise to 2016.</p>
