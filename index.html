              <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to my site! I'm a 24 year old guy
                  from Pewamo, MI. I'm an avid sports fan, mostly in football and basketball,
                  but I follow hockey and baseball as well. My favorite teams are the Spartans, Lions, Tigers,
                  Pistons, and Red Wings. In addition to sports, I'm big into video games as well.
                  My favorite game series are Halo, Fallout, NCAA Football, and Warcraft. Outside
                  of that, I enjoy being outside and being in the woods, hiking or kayaking.</p>
